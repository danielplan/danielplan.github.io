<p>
    There are many different ways to optimize your website for search engines. In this article, I will cover
    the more technical aspects of SEO. I will show you the most important HTML Tags and how to use them.
    Generally, the first thing that a search engine will do after it crawls your page is to analyze the HTML
    tags and content of your page. Therefore, there are a lot of tags to know, which help you with your SEO.
    Let's take a look at the most important HTML tags.<br>
    This is by no means a complete list of everything you need to know about SEO, but I will keep this updated
    while I learn more about this topic, so that it can be used as a reference for you.
</p>
<h2>
    The <code><head></code>-tag: Meta tags
</h2>
<p>
    The most widely known way to improve the SEO of a website is to add meta tags to the head of the page.
    Meta tags contain additional information about the web page and about the content it displays. Such tags are for
    example:
<ul>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    <li>Keywords</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
Let's have a look at them in detail and see how they can and how they are used.
</p>
<h3>
    Title
</h3>
<p>
    The title tag is the most important meta information of your page.
    It is a short text which gives a brief headline to the content of the page. It is displayed as the title of the
    search results and also showed in the browser tab.
    Using it is very easy and looks something like this:
</p>
<pre><code><html>
    <head>
        <!-- this is the title tag -->
        <title>A fascinating title | daniel plan.</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My website</h1>
    </body>
</html></code></pre>
<h3>
    Description
</h3>
<p>
    The description is the second most important
    meta information that the search engine will display directly to the users. It is a short text that is usually
    displayed directly under the page's title in search results. This looks something like this.
</p>
<img src="/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/google_screenshot.png"
    alt="A screenshot of Google displaying a search result" loading="lazy">
<p>
    As you can see, the image above shows a search result of Google. The description is the text that is displayed
    under the title, which in this case is "Google".<br>
    A description can be added to your HTML page by adding the following tag to the head of the page:
</p>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><html>
    <head>
        <title>A fascinating title | daniel plan.</title>
        <!-- this is the description tag -->
        <meta name="description" content="A fascinating description. This
        should be a general description of the contents of the page.">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My website</h1>
    </body>
</html></code></pre>

<p>
    Now that we have seen the two most important meta tags, let's take a look at some less straight forward ones.
</p>
<h3>
    Robots meta tag
</h3>
<p>
    The robots meta tag is used to explain to the crawler (the robot) which pages can be indexed and which pages can't,
    as
    well as if the links of the page should be followed (crawled) by the crawler. For that, we need to specify if the
    page is
    indexable (index) or not indexable (noindex). In addition to that we need to specify if the page is followable
    (follow) or
    not followable (nofollow).
    This may look something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>A fascinating title | daniel plan.</title>
        <meta name="description" content="A fascinating description. This
        should be a general description of the contents of the page.">
        <meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My website</h1>
</body>
</code></pre>
<p>The values specified above (index/noindex, follow/nofollow) are given with the structure above, comma seperated in
    the content attribute.</p>
<h3>
    Keywords meta tag
</h3>
<p>
    The Keywords meta tag simply allows us to specify keywords that are relevant to the page.
    This may look something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>A fascinating title | daniel plan.</title>
        <meta name="description" content="A fascinating description. This
        should be a general description of the contents of the page.">
        <meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My website</h1>
    </body>
</html></code></pre>
</code></pre>
<h3>
    Canonical meta tag
</h3>
<p>
    The canonical meta tag is used to describe that the page is a duplicate of another page.
    This may be handy if you have multiple pages with the same content but on different paths of your website.
    For instance, you might run into something like this:
</p>
<p>
    You have a page that displays a product on the path <code>/products/cool-shirt/</code>. However
    you also want to make it possible to access the page with the path <code>/summer-line/cool-shirt/</code>.
    For such cases you need to use the canonical meta tag to tell the crawler that the page is a duplicate of the
    page with the path <code>/summer-line/cool-shirt/</code>.
</p>

<p>Here is an exampleof the canonical meta tag:</p>
<pre><code><html>
    <head>
        <title>A fascinating title | daniel plan.</title>
        <meta name="description" content="A fascinating description. This
        should be a general description of the contents of the page.">
        <meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">
        <meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
        <meta name="canonical" content="https://www.danielplan.com/summer-line/cool-shirt/">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My website</h1>
    </body>
</html></code></pre>
<h3>
    Open Graph meta tags
</h3>
<p>
    The last meta tags I want to get into are the Open Graph meta tags.
    These are similar to the title and description meta tags, but they are not used by search engines, but by
    social media sites. They are used to describe the page to social media sites, so that a small widget can appear
    if someone shares your website on social media platforms.
</p>
<p>
    This allows you to add an image, a title and a description, as well as a type, a site name and a url, which are then
    displayed in the social media widget
    in posts.
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example of the Open Graph meta tags:
</p>
<pre><code><html>
    <head>
        <title>A fascinating title | daniel plan.</title>
        <meta name="description" content="A fascinating description. This
        should be a general description of the contents of the page.">
        <meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">
        <meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
        <meta name="canonical" content="https://www.danielplan.com/summer-line/cool-shirt/">
        <!-- Open graph (OG) tags-->
        <meta property="og:title" content="A fascinating title | daniel plan.">
        <meta property="og:description" content="A fascinating description. This
        should be a general description of the contents of the page.">
        <meta property="og:image" content="https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/og_image.png">
        <meta property="og:url" content="https://www.danielplan.com/summer-line/cool-shirt/">
        <meta property="og:type" content="website">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My website</h1>
    </body>
</html></code></pre>
<p>
    In the code snippet above, we can see how the Open Graph meta tags are used. The property attribute has to start
    with <code>og:</code> followed by the name of the attribute. The content attribute contains the value of the
    attribute.<br>
    Let's look at the different attributes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>og:title</code> - The title of the page.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>og:description</code> - The description of the page.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>og:image</code> - A preview image of the page - this is displayed as a banner in the widget.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>og:url</code> - The URL of the page.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>og:type</code> - The type of the page. Possible values here are for example <code>website</code>,
        <code>article</code> and more. <a href="https://ogp.me/#types" target="_blank">
            See all possible values here</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

<h2>
    Semantic HTML Tags
</h2>
<p>
    Now after we have seen how the head tag can be structured using meta tags, we still have to improve how our
    <code><body></code> tag is presented to the search engine. Since HTML5 we are we have a lot of new tags that can be
    used to describe
    how the content of our website is structured, so that web crawlers and robots are able to understand the content
    of our website.
</p>
<p>
    Semantic HTML tags are simple to use and easy to understand, nevertheless they oftentimes are forgotten
    while building websites. So let's briefly explain which ones exist and how they work. Let's first look at a quick
    sketch
    I made of how a page may be structured, using semantic HTML-Tags
</p>
<img src="/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/page_sketch.png" alt="Sketch of page structure, using semantic HTML5-Tags">
<h3>
    <code><header></code>-tag
</h3>
<p>
    The header tag is used to describe the header-section of a page. This usually contains the company's logo,
    a navigation and other links and is displayed at the top of the page. A header can also be the headline
    of an article or a page. It can be used multiple times throughout the page, but can (for obvious reasons) only be
    outside of a
    <code><footer></code>- and <code><address></code>-tag.
</p>
<h3>
    <code><footer></code>-tag
</h3>
<p>
    The footer tag is used to describe the footer-section of a page or a section within a page.
    This usually contains the copyright notice, contact information, author information
    a navigation and other links and is displayed at the bottom of the page. You can use this tag multiple times
    throughout the page.
</p>
<h3>
    <code><address></code>-tag
</h3>
<p>
    The address tag is used to describe the contact information of a company or a person.
    This usually contains the address, phone number, email address and other contact information.
</p>
<h3>
    <code><article></code>-tag and <code><section></code>-tag
</h3>
<p>
    These two tags are very similar but have different semantic meaning, both of them describe section of pages,
    whereas the
    <code><article></code>-tag describes articles only. Such articles might be forum posts, user comments, blog posts
    and more.
    The section is more general purpose and just defines that content within it can be interpreted as one
    section of the
    whole document
    and has some form of connection within it, but are not self-contained.
</p>
<p>
    So simply-said: the article tag describes content that is self-contained and has no connection to the
    rest of the
    page.
    The section tag describes content that is connected to the rest of the page.
</p>
<h3>
    <code><nav></code>-tag
</h3>
<p>
    The nav tag is used to describe the navigation of a page. This usually contains the links to other pages
    and
    other content, which might even be on the same page, such as anchors to sections of the page.
    There can be multiple nav tags on a page.<br>
    However not all the links should be within navigation tags. It is only intended to be used for multiple
    links
    grouped together, which form a navigation.
</p>
<h3>
    <code><aside></code>-tag
</h3>
<p>
    The aside tag symbolizes a side-section of a page. This usually is a sidebar or a sidebar widget which
    is displayed
    next to the main
    content of a website.
</p>
<h3>
    <code><figure></code>-tag and <code><figcaption></code>-tag
</h3>
<p>
    The figure tag is used to describe some form of image or a graphic, usually with a caption.
    It usually contains an <code>img</code>-tag to display the image and a <code>figcaption</code>-tag to
    describe the
    caption of the graphic. The caption needs to be either the first or the last child of the figure tag.
    Let's look at
    an example
</p>
<pre><code><figure>
    <img src="https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/figure_image.png" alt="A caption">
    <figcaption>A caption</figcaption>
</figure></code></pre>
<h3>
    <code><time></code>-tag
</h3>
<p>
    This tag is used to define, that certain content is related to a date/ a certain time. It is used that
    certain
    strings of text can be readable for the web browsers and machines. This is useful, for instance, if you
    want to
    display a date or a time in a way, that some agent would be able to add it to the user's calendar.
</p>
<p>
    Since this tag includes an attribute, let's have a look at how it may be used.
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-xml"><time datetime="2016-01-01">January 1st, 2016</time></code></pre>
<pre><code class="hljs language-xml"><time datetime="20:00">20:00</time></code></pre>
<p>
    The <code>datetime</code>-attribute is used to give the date and time of the content in machine-readable
    way.
    If you are interested in this tag, please consult the <a target="_blank"
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time">
        Mozilla Developer Network</a> for more information.
</p>
<h3>
    <code><main></code>-tag
</h3>
<p>
    The main tag is used to define which part of the page contains the main content of the page, outside
    from the header
    and footer. This tag can only be used once in a page and must be outside of the header-, footer-,
    aside-, article-
    and nav-tag.
</p>
<h3>
    Other important tags
</h3>
<p>
    Nevertheless, not only the new HTML5 tags have semantic meaning, also the old HTML tags have some meta
    information
    that needs to be considered when building a website. Also, there are tags that are important to use
    correctly
    to ensure good SEO.
</p>
<h4>Heading tags</h4>
<p>
    For example, the <code><h1></code>-tag is used to describe the main headline of a page. It is crucial
    for
    SEO and should only be used once on a page. The rest of the heading tags are used to describe the
    sub-headlines of
    a page in a hierarchical order. For instance:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-xml"><h1>The basics of SEO</h1>
<h2>Head-Tags</h2>
<h3>Title-Tag</h3>
<h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
<h3>HTML5-Tags</h3>
<h4>Main-Tag</h4></code></pre>
<h4><code><img></code>-tag</h4>
<p>
    The image tag needs to have an <code>alt</code>-attribute to describe the image. This is crucial for SEO
    and
    is mainly used for machines to understand the content of the image, which would otherwise be
    inaccessible for them.
    It should contain a few words that describe the image. For instance:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-xml"><img 
    src="https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/figure_image.png" 
    alt="A caption"
/></code></pre>
<p>
    Also the <code>height</code>- and <code>width</code>-attributes are important to use, since they are
    used to
    define the size of the image in the page, so that the website-renderer knows, how large the image will
    be, without
    loading the image or the CSS.
    Otherwise, the image might force to page the size of the page after it has been loaded, which would be a
    bad
    experience for the user and therefore is punished by search engines.
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-xml"><img 
    src="https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/figure_image.png" 
    alt="A caption"
    height="300"
    width="300"
/></code></pre>
<h4><code><strong></code> and <code><em></code></h4>
<p>
    <code><strong></code> and <code><em></code> are very similar to the <code><b></code> and
    <code><i></code>
    in their styling, but give a semantic meaning to it. <code><strong></code> is used to describe that some
    words in the text are important and may be used for important keywords that can help the user or agent navigate
    through your text. <code><em></code> is more used to lay emphasize on a portion of text, that needs to be read
    in a different tone. With it, the text can be read and therefore understood easily by the user and the agent can
    give the text portion more relevance.

</p>
<h2>
    Structured data: Schema.org
</h2>
<p>
    Another important topic for SEO is structured data. Similar to meta data, structured data is used to
    give the search engines additional information about content of a page, so that they can render
    beautiful and understandable widgets to the user of the search engine, so-called "rich results".
    This data is not only used by search engines, but also other agents, who crawl the web.
</p>
<p>
    In this section, I will only give a brief overview of some types and how it is used. For more information,
    please consult the <a target="_blank" href="https://schema.org/">
        Schema.org</a>-website.
</p>
<h3>An example of structured data</h3>
<p>
    First, let's have a look at a simple example of structured data, so that you know what I'm talking about.
    Let's say you create a blog article and you
    want that search engines understand that this web page is a blog post. For that, you need to add the following
    meta-data to the <code><head></code> of your HTML-Document:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-xml"><script type="application/ld+json">{
    "@context": "http://schema.org",
    "@type": "Article",
    "headline": "The basics of SEO",
    "datePublished": "2016-01-01",
    "dateModified": "2016-01-01",
    "author": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "Daniel Plan"
    },
    "publisher": {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": "Daniel Plan",
        "logo": {
            "@type": "ImageObject",
            "url": "https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/logo.png"
        }
    },
    "description": "This is a blog post about the basics of SEO for developers.",
    "mainEntityOfPage": {
        "@type": "WebPage",
        "@id": "https://www.danielplan.com/blog/seo-for-developers-basic"
    },
    "image": {
        "@type": "ImageObject",
        "url": "https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/figure_image.png",
        "height": "300",
        "width": "300"
    }
}</script></code></pre>
<p>
    As you can see in the snippet above, structured data is added using a JSON-LD-format. The
    <code>@context</code>-attribute defines that we are in fact adding structured data using the schema.org
    notation.<br>
    The <code>@type</code>-attribute is used to define the type of the schema.<br>
    The other attributes are defined by the type of structured data you implement and it values come
    from the the content you want to describe. Using these
    attributes, the search engine can understand your page and can render the correct widgets to the user.
</p>
<h3>Types of Schemas</h3>
<p>
    Now that you have a simple understanding on how to use structured data, let's have a look at some more
    types of structured data. There are many different types that are available for structured data, the most common
    ones are for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Organization</strong>: used to describe information about an organization such as companies, schools
        etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Person</strong>: This type is used to describe a person.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Product</strong>: This describes a product or a service, it contains information such as price, rating
        etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Event</strong>: This type is used to describe an event, it contains information such as date, location
        etc. Events may be lectures, concerts, festivals, workshops etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Recipe</strong>: Used to describe a recipe, it contains information such as ingredients, cooking
        instructions etc. Recipes are rendered as widgets on the search engine's result page. Using the data of the
        schema,
        recipes can even be found using ingredients and calories.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Place</strong>: This type is used to describe a place, it contains information such as address,
        opening hours etc. It is used to describe a location, such as a restaurant, a hotel, a museum etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you are interested in more types of structured data, Google offers a great resource where they list the different
    types
    and how they are rendered on the search engine's result <a title="Google using structured data"
