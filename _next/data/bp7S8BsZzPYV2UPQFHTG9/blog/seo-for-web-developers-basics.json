In this article, I will cover\n    the more technical aspects of SEO. I will show you the <strong>most important HTML Tags</strong> and how to use\n    them, as well\n    as how to develop your websites in a way, that web crawlers have a better time understanding them.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Generally, the first thing that a search engine will do after crawling your page is to analyze the HTML\n    tags and content of your page. Therefore, there are a lot of tags you should know, which help you with your SEO.\n    Let's take a look at the most important HTML tags.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Note before we start: This is article by no means a complete list of everything you need to know about SEO, but I\n    will keep this\n    article\n    updated\n    while I learn more about this topic, so that you can use it as a reference while developing your websites.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>-tag: Meta tags\n</h2>\n<p>\n    The most widely known way to improve the SEO of a website is to add meta tags to the head of the page.\n    Meta tags contain additional information about the web page and about the content it displays. Such tags contain for\n    example:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>The page title</li>\n    <li>A description</li>\n    <li>Keywords</li>\n    <li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Let's have a look at some of them in detail and see how they can and how they are used.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Title\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The title tag is the most important meta information of your page.\n    It is a <strong>short headline</strong> that gives a general idea about the content of your website. It is shown as\n    a heading\n    in search results and is also displayed in the browser tab. Using it is very easy and looks something like this:\n</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;!-- this is the title tag --&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;A fascinating title | daniel plan.&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;My website&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>\n    Description\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The description is the second most important\n    meta information that the search engine will display directly to the users. It is a <strong>short text</strong> that\n    is usually\n    displayed beneath the page's title in the search results:\n</p>\n<img src=\"/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/google_screenshot.png\"\n    alt=\"A screenshot of Google displaying a search result\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<p>\n    A description can be added to your HTML page by adding the following tag to the head of the page:\n</p>\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;A fascinating title | daniel plan.&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;!-- this is the description tag --&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;A fascinating description. This\n        should be a general description of the contents of the page.&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;My website&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<h3>\n    Favicon\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The favicon is a <strong>tiny image/icon</strong> displayed next to the page's title in the <strong>browser\n        tab</strong>. It is used\n    to identify the\n    website in the browser, after saving it to your bookmarks or after cluttering the browser's tab bar with other\n    websites. There are many different ways to include a favicon, but the most common way is to use a link to the\n    favicon\n    in the head of the page.\n</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;A fascinating title | daniel plan.&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;A fascinating description. This\n        should be a general description of the contents of the page.&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;favicon.ico&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;My website&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>\n    Modern browser nowadays also support many other formats such as <code>.svg</code>, <code>.png</code>,\n    <code>.jpg</code>, etc.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Robots\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The robots meta tag is used to define how the <strong>crawler</strong> should interact with your webpage.\n    In this case a crawler is, simply said, a bot that browses through\n    the internet and makes itself a list of all the pages it finds and the information it could find out about it,\n    this process is called indexing. With the robots meta tag, we can define which pages can be indexed and which pages\n    should be ignored,\n    as well as if the links of the page should be followed.\n    For that, we need to specify if the\n    page is <strong>indexable (index) or not indexable (noindex)</strong> and if the page should be <strong>followed\n        (follow) or not (nofollow).</strong>\n    This may look something like this:\n</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;A fascinating title | daniel plan.&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;A fascinating description. This\n        should be a general description of the contents of the page.&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;favicon.ico&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Should be indexed and followed --&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;index, follow&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Should be indexed but not followed --&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;index, nofollow&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Should not be indexed but followed --&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex, follow&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Should not be indexed and not be followed --&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex, nofollow&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;My website&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>\n    The values specified above (index/noindex, follow/nofollow) need to be given in this structure, so that\n    the crawler can read it (comma separated and in the content attribute).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Even though it may seem a bit useless at first, this tag is actually\n    very important. With it, you can tell the crawler that some page may not be indexed. This is handy, if you have\n    pages\n    that are not supposed to be indexed, such as hidden pages. This needs to be considered, when creating a website,\n    since sometimes we create pages that are not intended to be indexed.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Keywords\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The Keywords meta tag simply allows us to specify keywords that are <strong>relevant to the page.</strong>\n    This may look something like this:\n</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;A fascinating title | daniel plan.&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;A fascinating description. This\n        should be a general description of the contents of the page.&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;favicon.ico&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;keyword1, keyword2, keyword3&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;My website&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n    The keywords are simply separated by commas. Later in this article we will see another way to highlight keywords\n    in the paragraphs of your page, using the <code>strong</code> tag.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Canonical URL\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The canonical meta tag is used to describe that the page is a <strong>duplicate of another page.</strong>\n    This is needed if you have multiple pages with the same content but on different paths of your website.\n    For instance, you might run into a situation similar to this one:\n</p>\n<p>\n    You have a page that displays a product on the path <code>/products/cool-shirt/</code>. However\n    you also want to make it available with the path <code>/products/summer-line/cool-shirt/</code>.\n    For such cases you need to use the canonical meta tag to tell the crawler that the page is a duplicate of the\n    page with the path <code>/summer-line/cool-shirt/</code>.\n</p>\n\n<p>Here is an exampleof the canonical meta tag:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;A fascinating title | daniel plan.&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;A fascinating description. This\n        should be a general description of the contents of the page.&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;keyword1, keyword2, keyword3&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;index, follow&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;canonical&quot; content=&quot;https://www.danielplan.com/summer-line/cool-shirt/&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;My website&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>\n    Open Graph\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The last type of meta tags I want to get into are the Open Graph tags.\n    These are very similar to the meta tags described above, yet they are not used by search engines\n    or the\n    browser, but\n    were created to be used by <strong>social media platforms.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Open Graph tags describe the page to social media sites, so\n    that they are able to render a widget when the user shares the web-page\n    in a post. These widgets usually contain a <strong>title, a short description and an image.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Here is an example of how Open Graph tags can be implemented on your page:\n</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;A fascinating title | daniel plan.&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;A fascinating description. This\n        should be a general description of the contents of the page.&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;keyword1, keyword2, keyword3&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;index, follow&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;canonical&quot; content=&quot;https://www.danielplan.com/summer-line/cool-shirt/&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Open graph (OG) tags--&gt;\n        &lt;meta property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;A fascinating title | daniel plan.&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta property=&quot;og:description&quot; content=&quot;A fascinating description. This\n        should be a general description of the contents of the page.&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta property=&quot;og:image&quot; content=&quot;https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/og_image.png&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta property=&quot;og:url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.danielplan.com/summer-line/cool-shirt/&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;meta property=&quot;og:type&quot; content=&quot;website&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;My website&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>\n    In the code snippet above, we can see how the Open Graph meta tags are used. The property attribute <strong>has to\n        start\n        with <code>og:</code></strong> followed by the name of the attribute. The content attribute contains the value\n    of the\n    attribute.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Let's look at the different attributes that the Open Graph Protocol allows:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <code>og:title</code> - The title of the page.<br>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <code>og:description</code> - The description of the page.<br>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <code>og:image</code> - A preview image of the page - this is displayed as a banner in the widget.<br>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <code>og:url</code> - The URL of the page.<br>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <code>og:type</code> - The type of the page. Possible values here are for example <code>website</code>,\n        <code>article</code> and more. <a href=\"https://ogp.me/#types\" target=\"_blank\">\n            See all possible values here</a>.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you are further interested in the Open Graph meta tags, you can find more information on the <a\n        href=\"https://ogp.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Graph Protocol</a>.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Semantic HTML-Tags\n</h2>\n<p>\n    After we have seen how the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>-tag can be structured using meta tags, we still have to improve the\n    structure and the content of our <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>-tag.\n</p>\n<p>\n    With HTML5, a lot of semantic tags have been introduced. These are tags that do\n    <strong>not change the styling of your page,</strong> but give certain elements of your web-page a meaning and\n    context\n    just by looking at the HTML-Structure. This means,\n    that instead of\n    using\n    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, we can use such tags to say that a certain <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, for\n    instance, is actually the page's navigation. Using this information, web crawlers are able to understand the\n    structure of our page, <strong>without\n        actually seeing it.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Semantic HTML tags are simple to use and easy to understand. Nevertheless, they are <strong>oftentimes\n        forgotten</strong>\n    while building websites. So let's briefly explain which ones exist and how they work. Let's first look at a quick\n    sketch of how a page may be structured, using semantic HTML-Tags\n</p>\n<img src=\"/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/page_sketch.png\" alt=\"Sketch of page structure, using semantic HTML5-Tags\">\n<h3>\n    <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>-tag\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The header tag is used to define the/a <strong>header-section of a page.</strong> This section usually contains the\n    <strong>company's logo,\n        a navigation and other links</strong> and is displayed at the top of the page. However, a header can also be the\n    <strong>headline</strong>\n    of an article or a page. It can be used multiple times throughout the page, but can (for obvious reasons) only be\n    used outside of a\n    <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>- and <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>-tag.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>-tag\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The footer tag is used to describe the footer-section of a the <strong>whole website or a section within a\n        page.</strong>\n    This usually contains <strong>the copyright notice, contact information, author information\n        a navigation and other links</strong> and is displayed at the bottom of the page. You can use this tag multiple\n    times\n    throughout the page.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>-tag\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The address tag is used to describe the <strong>contact information of a company or a person.</strong>\n    This usually contains the address, phone number, email address and other contact information.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>-tag and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>-tag\n</h3>\n<p>\n    These two tags are very similar but still have a small difference in their semantic meaning.\n    First, both of them describe a section of page. However, the most important difference is that\n    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>-tag needs to be <strong>self-contained</strong> and should therefore be used for parts of a\n    page, that\n    are in a way self-sufficient. This means that a great example for the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>-tag are for example\n    <strong>comments</strong> since\n    once a comment is over, there is not coming any new content that has to do with this specific comment. Obviously,\n    just by looking at the name of the tag\n    any form of article can also be within the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>-tag.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>-tag is used to describe a section of a page, meaning that it is not self-contained and\n    <strong>relies to other section to form a complete page.</strong> This tag is therefore used if you, for instance,\n    have multiple\n    parts\n    on your page, such as a an about-section or a contact-form. Since they both form the whole page they can be seen as\n    sections\n    of the page.\n    The section is therefore more general purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n    So simply-said:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        the <code>article</code>-tag describes content that is self-contained.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        the <code>section</code>-tag describes content that is only a part of the whole page.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>-tag\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The <code>nav</code>-tag is used to describe the navigation of a page. This usually contains <strong>links to other\n        web pages or\n        anchors within the current page.</strong>\n    There can be multiple nav tags on a page.\n</p>\n<p>\n    However not all the links should be within navigation tags. It is only intended to be used for multiple\n    links\n    <strong>grouped together,</strong> which form a navigation.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>-tag\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The <code>aside</code>-tag symbolizes a side-section of a page. This usually is a sidebar or a some form of widget\n    which\n    is displayed\n    next to the main\n    content of a website.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>-tag and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>-tag\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The <code>figure</code>-tag is used to describe some form of image or a chart, usually with a caption.\n    It usually contains an <code>img</code>-tag to display the image and a <code>figcaption</code>-tag to\n    describe the\n    caption of the graphic. The caption needs to be either the <strong>first or the last child</strong> of the figure\n    tag.\n    Let's look at\n    an example\n</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;figure&gt;\n    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/figure_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;A caption&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;figcaption&gt;A caption&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>\n    <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>-tag\n</h3>\n<p>\n    This tag is used to define, that certain content is related to a date or a certain time. With it,\n    certain\n    strings of text can become readable for the <strong>web browsers and machines\n        other .</strong> This is useful, for\n    instance, if you\n    want to\n    display a date or a time in a way, that some agent would be able to add it to the user's calendar.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Since this tag includes an attribute, let's have a look at how it may be used.\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-xml\">&lt;time datetime=&quot;2016-01-01&quot;&gt;January 1st, 2016&lt;/time&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-xml\">&lt;time datetime=&quot;20:00&quot;&gt;20:00&lt;/time&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>\n    The <code>datetime</code>-attribute is used to give the date and time of the content in machine-readable\n    way.\n    If you are interested in this tag, please consult the <a target=\"_blank\"\n        href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time\">\n        Mozilla Developer Network</a> for more information on how this attribute can be formed.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>-tag\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The <code>main</code>-tag is used to define which part of the page contains the <strong>main content</strong> of the\n    page. This tag can only be used <strong>once</strong> in a page and must be outside of <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>-,\n    <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>-,\n    <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>-, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>-\n    and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>-tags.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Other important tags\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Nevertheless, not only the new HTML5 tags have semantic meaning, but also the old HTML tags have some meta\n    information\n    that needs to be considered when building a website. In addition to that, there are tags that are important to use\n    correctly\n    to ensure good SEO.\n</p>\n<h4>Heading tags</h4>\n<p>\n    The order of and structure heading tags is crucial when developing a site.\n    For example, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-tag is used to describe the main headline of a page. This tag\n    can and should only be used once on a page. The rest of the heading tags are used to describe the\n    sub-headlines of\n    a page in a hierarchical order. For instance:\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-xml\">&lt;h1&gt;The basics of SEO&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Head-Tags&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Title-Tag&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Semantic HTML&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;HTML5-Tags&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Main-Tag&lt;/h4&gt;</code></pre>\n<h4><code>&lt;img&gt;</code>-tag</h4>\n<p>\n    The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>-tag needs to have an <code>alt</code>-attribute to describe the image. This is crucial for\n    SEO\n    and\n    is mainly used for machines to understand the content of the image, which would otherwise be\n    inaccessible for them.\n    It should contain a few words that describe the image. For instance:\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-xml\">&lt;img \n    src=&quot;https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/figure_image.png&quot; \n    alt=&quot;A caption&quot;\n/&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>\n    Also the <code>height</code>- and <code>width</code>-attributes are important to use, since they are\n    used to\n    define the size of the image on the page, so that the website-renderer knows, how large the image will\n    be, without\n    loading the image itself or the CSS.\n    Otherwise, the image might force to page to resize after it has been loaded, which would be a\n    bad\n    experience for the user and therefore is punished by search engines.\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-xml\">&lt;img \n    src=&quot;https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/figure_image.png&quot; \n    alt=&quot;A caption&quot;\n    height=&quot;300&quot;\n    width=&quot;300&quot;\n/&gt;</code></pre>\n<h4><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code></h4>\n<p>\n    <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> are very similar to the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and\n    <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>\n    in their styling, but add a semantic meaning to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> is used to describe that some\n    words in the text are <strong>important</strong> and may be be used by crawlers as keywords for your page.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n    <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is used to lay emphasize on a portion of text, that needs to be read\n    in a <strong>different tone.</strong> With it,\n    the agent/web crawler can\n    give the text portion more relevance.\n\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Structured data: Schema.org\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Another interesting topic of SEO is structured data. Similar to meta data, structured data is used to\n    give the search engines <strong>additional information</strong> about content of a page in a machine-readable way,\n    so that they can render\n    beautiful and understandable widgets to the user of the search engine, with so-called \"rich results\".\n    This data is not only used by search engines, but also other agents, who crawl the web.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In this section, I will only give a brief overview of some types and how it is used. For more information,\n    please consult the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://schema.org/\">\n        Schema.org</a>-website.\n</p>\n<h3>An example of structured data</h3>\n<p>\n    First, let's have a look at a simple example of structured data, so that you know what I'm talking about.\n    Let's say you create a <strong>blog article</strong> and you\n    want that search engines understand that this web page is a blog post. For that, you need to add the following\n    meta-data to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your HTML-Document:\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-xml\">&lt;script type=&quot;application/ld+json&quot;&gt;{\n    &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;http://schema.org&quot;,\n    &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;Article&quot;,\n    &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;The basics of SEO&quot;,\n    &quot;datePublished&quot;: &quot;2016-01-01&quot;,\n    &quot;dateModified&quot;: &quot;2016-01-01&quot;,\n    &quot;author&quot;: {\n        &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;Person&quot;,\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Daniel Plan&quot;\n    },\n    &quot;publisher&quot;: {\n        &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;Organization&quot;,\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Daniel Plan&quot;,\n        &quot;logo&quot;: {\n            &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;ImageObject&quot;,\n            &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/logo.png&quot;\n        }\n    },\n    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is a blog post about the basics of SEO for developers.&quot;,\n    &quot;mainEntityOfPage&quot;: {\n        &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;WebPage&quot;,\n        &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;https://www.danielplan.com/blog/seo-for-developers-basic&quot;\n    },\n    &quot;image&quot;: {\n        &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;ImageObject&quot;,\n        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.danielplan.com/img/blog/seo-for-developers-basic/figure_image.png&quot;,\n        &quot;height&quot;: &quot;300&quot;,\n        &quot;width&quot;: &quot;300&quot;\n    }\n}&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>\n    As you can see in the snippet above, structured data is added using a JSON-LD-format. The\n    <code>@context</code>-attribute defines that we are in fact adding structured data using the <strong>schema.org\n        structure.</strong><br>\n    The <code>@type</code>-attribute is used to define the <strong>type of object</strong> you want to describe.<br>\n    The other attributes are depend on the type of structured data you implement and its values come\n    from the the content you want to describe. Using these\n    attributes, the search engine can understand your page and can render the correct widgets to the user.\n</p>\n<h3>Types of Schemas</h3>\n<p>\n    Now that you have a simple understanding on how to use structured data, let's have a look at some more\n    types of structured data. There are many different types that are available for structured data, the most common\n    ones are for:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Organization</strong>: used to describe information about an organization such as companies, schools\n        etc.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Person</strong>: This type is used to describe a person.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Product</strong>: This describes a product or a service, it contains information such as price, rating\n        etc.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Event</strong>: This type is used to describe an event, it contains information such as date, location\n        etc. Events may be lectures, concerts, festivals, workshops etc.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Recipe</strong>: Used to describe a recipe, it contains information such as ingredients, cooking\n        instructions etc. Recipes are rendered as widgets on the search engine's result page. Using the data of the\n        schema,\n        recipes can even be found using only ingredients and calories.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Place</strong>: This type is used to describe a place, it contains information such as address,\n        opening hours etc. Locations can be restaurants, hotels, museums etc.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    If you are interested in more types of structured data, <a\n        href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/search-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">\n        Google offers a great resource where they list the different\n        and how they are rendered on the search engine's result\n    </a>\n</p>"}},"__N_SSG":true}
